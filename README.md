# Docker Images for fast.ai course

In preperation for the realease of fastai v2 and the new course, released on August 21st 2020, I am preparing these images for my own use and sharing them in case anbody else want them.

Unlike other images these just provide the jupyter notebook environment with all dependencies and you keep the actual fast.ai repo on you local server to mount into the docker container. I just found this easier for when it comes to saving your work.
